## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
CLC_spectrum <- read.delim("~/CLC_spectrum.txt", header=FALSE)
Wavlength=CLC_spectrum[1:2078,1]
Transmission=CLC_spectrum[1:2078,2]
average_T=mean(Transmission)
print(average_T)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(Wavlength,Transmission)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
